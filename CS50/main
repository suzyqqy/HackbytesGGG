        Welcome! This is your all-in-one platform to find everything you need to know to start guerilla gardening!
        <br>
        Guerilla gardening is a fun, achievable and positive way to make our local areas more green. It involves:
        <br>
        <h2>1. Finding the best plants to nurture for your local climate.</h2>
        You need plants that will cooperate with preexisting flora and fauna. Ideally, also ones that produce a large amount of oxygen!
        <br>
        <h2>2. Finding the perfect location.</h2>
        Scout out your area for some prime fixer-upper dirt areas. Think roundabouts with half-dead grass, banks between the pavement and the road, unused flower pots in your town centre.

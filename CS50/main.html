            This is your all-in-one platform to find everything you need to know to start guerilla gardening!
            <br>
            Guerrilla gardening is is technically defined as gardening on land without legal rights, such as abandoned sites, areas that are not being cared for, or private property. However, the movement takes positive action against climate change and almost never invokes legal action. It's a fun, affordable and exciting way to improve your local area, and just takes a bit of time and effort to achieve.

        <h2>1. Find the best plants to nurture for your local climate.</h2>
        <br>
        You need plants that will cooperate with preexisting flora and fauna. Ideally, also ones that produce a large amount of oxygen!

        <h2>2. Find the perfect location.</h2>
        Scout out your area for some prime fixer-upper dirt areas. Think roundabouts with half-dead grass, banks between the pavement and the road, unused flower pots in your town centre. These locations will likely be pretty small, but don't let that stop you!
        Once you've found your spot, test the soil to ensure it will successfully foster a garden. Don;;t worry; testing soil is actually quite simple! You can read our guide for a simple explanation.
